# Exercise 1: Print First 10 natural numbers using while loop
# n = 1
# while(n < 11):
#     print(n)
#     n+=1

# Exercise 2: Print the following pattern
# 1 
# 1 2 
# 1 2 3 
# 1 2 3 4 
# 1 2 3 4 5
# j= 1
# for i in range(1,6):
#     for j in range(i+1):
#         print(j, end=' ')
#     print(" ")

# Exercise 3: Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number
# n = int(input("Enter any number:"))
# counter = 0

# for i in range(n+1):
#     counter = counter+i   
# print(counter)

# x = sum(range(n+1))
# print(x)

# Exercise 4: Write a program to print multiplication table of a given number
# i = int(input("Enter any number:"))

# for j in range(1,11):
#     print(i*j)

# Exercise 5: Display numbers from a list using loop
# Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

# The number must be divisible by five
# If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number
# If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop

# numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

# for n in numbers:
#         if n > 500:
#             break
#         elif n > 150:
#             continue
#         elif n % 5 == 0:
#            print(n)

# Exercise 6: Count the total number of digits in a number

# number = 75869
# count = 0

# while number!=0:
#     number = number // 10 
#     count = count + 1
# print(count)

# Exercise 7: Print the following pattern

# for i in range(0, 6):
#     for j in range(5-i,0,-1):
#         print(j, end=" ")
#     print(" ")

#Exercise 8: Print list in reverse order using a loop

# list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# size = len(list1)-1

# for i in range(size, -1,-1):
#     print(list1[i])

#Exercise 9: Display numbers from -10 to -1 using for loop
# for i in range(-10, 0, 1):
#   print(i)
